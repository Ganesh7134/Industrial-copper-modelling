# Industrial-copper-modelling
**Goals:**

* Develop machine learning models to analyze and predict key business outcomes.
* Focus on two tasks:
    * **Predicting Selling Price:** Estimate the continuous variable "Selling_Price" based on various features using a regression model.
    * **Predicting Status:** Predict the binary variable "Status" (WON/LOST) associated with each data point using a classification model.

# Project Stages

**1. Data Exploration and Cleaning:**

* Analyze data for skewness, outliers, and missing values.
* Employ data cleaning techniques to ensure high-quality data.
* Perform necessary transformations like scaling and encoding categorical features.

**2. Selling Price Regression:**

* Train a suitable regression model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor) for "Selling_Price".
* Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
* Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal accuracy and generalization.

**3. Status Classification:**

* Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier) for "Status".
* Assess performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Analyze misclassifications and consider class imbalance handling (if necessary).

**4. Streamlit Application:**

* Develop a user-friendly interface using Streamlit for data input.
* The application will predict "Selling_Price" and "Status" based on the trained models.
* This provides an interactive platform for exploring and analyzing model predictions.
